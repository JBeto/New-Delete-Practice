## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* arr = new int[5];
    int** arr2 = &arr;
    int** arr3 = arr2;
    cout << arr2 << endl;
    delete[] arr;
    cout << *arr2 << endl;
    arr = nullptr;
    return 0;
}
```

## Instructions
Draw out a picture of each variable/memory location after the code executes.
Any deletions should be shown as a cross-out (X) over the memory deleted.
Explain the output of the program at each cout step / any undefined behavior.
