## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* arr = new int[5];
    arr[2] = 2;
    arr[3] = 3;
    arr[4] = 4;
    cout << *arr << endl;
    int* temp = arr;
    delete[] temp;
    cout << *arr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Instructions
Draw out a picture of each variable after the code executes: arr, temp
Any deletions should be shown as a cross-out (X) over the memory deleted.
Explain the output of the program at each cout step / any undefined behavior.
