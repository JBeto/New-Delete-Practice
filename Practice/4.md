## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char* c_string = new char[10];
    char str[] = "Hi there!"; 
    c_string = &str[3];
    cout << *str << c_string << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Instructions
Draw out a picture of each variable/memory location after the code executes.
Any deletions should be shown as a cross-out (X) over the memory deleted.
Explain the output of the program at each cout step / any undefined behavior.
